I am a mechanical engineer. I have worked as a researcher for many years. It is a challenging and exciting job. However, time changes, then everything changes. Especially this pandemic, Covid-19, I have realized that I need to change to make a better life.

First, I want flexibility in my working life. As a mechanical engineer, I found that it is not easy to move between countries. I originally came from Thailand. My family is still living there. I want to go back and live with them or close to them. Like a software engineer and data scientist, a computer engineer can rotate between countries easier than other field engineers. Many friends of mine moved and relocated between Japan, Singapore, the USA, and even Thailand. Furthermore, after Covid-19, many tech companies allowed their employees to work from home.

Second, I want to improve my skills in data management. As a research engineer, I have worked with tons of data. Most of them are from an experiment. My daily routine is collecting data and analyze them. Excel is the tool I am using. Excel is a useful tool, but it would be better to have another tool to help me handle more data, more function, or better visualization.

For many people, this Covid-19 might be a problem, but it is an opportunity that could help me obtain what I want. Then, I decided to take a new step in data science.
