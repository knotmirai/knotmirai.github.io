# Movie Trend Analysis
This is my first project of the online data scien course.

Supposing that, Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about producing movies.

In this project, I will do the data analysis and present to understand the movie industry trend better. Several questions need to be answered:

1. What is a popular movie?
2. What is a popular genre?
3. Does the popularity affect the gross?
4. What is the relationship between popularity and production budget?
5. Which studio produces movies the most?

A movie-related data is from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

If anyone is interested in my project, please feel free to have a look at the following link:

## Summary

The movie's trend is like the Top 10 movies I presented in my presentation from my analysis. The most recommended genre is Action.
The popularity affects the worldwide gross, especially the popularity less than 55. With a budget of fewer than 300 million dollars, the production budget and popularity are positive correlation. Finally, Walt Disney studio is the most producing studio.


## Future Plan

For the future, I should include more factors to increase the accuracy, such as:

* casts or producers
* releasing time
* more specific budget range

Also, the statistical model should be applied for better prediction.
